# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.6.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- **Wheel packaging** — removed redundant `artifacts` and `force-include`
  entries for `inventory_md/data/`; `packages = ["src/inventory_md"]` already
  covers git-tracked data files, the duplicate entries caused a 400 error from
  PyPI on upload

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Tingbok integration** — inventory-md now fetches the package vocabulary
  from [tingbok.plann.no](https://tingbok.plann.no) by default, with
  transparent fallback to the bundled `vocabulary.yaml` if unreachable
  - New `fetch_vocabulary_from_tingbok()` in `vocabulary.py`
  - `load_global_vocabulary()` gains `tingbok_url` and `skip_cwd` parameters
  - `Config.tingbok_url` property (config key `tingbok.url`,
    env var `INVENTORY_MD_TINGBOK__URL`); defaults to `https://tingbok.plann.no`
  - Set `tingbok.url` to an empty string or `"false"` to disable
- **Direct/REST lookups for DBpedia and Wikidata** — reduces SPARQL load and
  avoids Wikidata rate limiting
  - DBpedia: direct URI construction (Title_Case → resource URL) verified
    with a lightweight SPARQL query, before REST search and full SPARQL
  - Wikidata: MediaWiki Action API (`wbsearchentities` + `wbgetentities`),
    not subject to SPARQL rate limits, before SPARQL label search
  - Wikidata broader concept chain (P31/P279) resolved via REST, making the
    REST lookup path fully SPARQL-free
- **Retry with exponential backoff** for SPARQL and DBpedia REST queries —
  respects `Retry-After` headers on 429s; retries up to 3 times
- **Circuit breaker** — after 5 consecutive endpoint failures, subsequent
  queries are skipped immediately to avoid cascading timeouts
- **SKOS cache directory configurable** via `INVENTORY_MD_SKOS__CACHE_DIR`
  env var; defaults to `~/.cache/inventory-md/skos/`; cache TTL increased
  from 30 to 60 days
- **Multi-source tracking per concept** — new `source_uris` field on `Concept`
  tracks all taxonomy sources (OFF, AGROVOC, DBpedia, Wikidata) that matched
  each concept, with their URIs
  - `_populate_source_uris()` fills `source_uris` from hierarchy-building data
  - `_find_additional_translation_uris()` discovers supplementary DBpedia/Wikidata
    URIs for concepts originally matched via OFF/AGROVOC only
  - Translation phases use `source_uris` directly instead of filtering by URI prefix
  - Search UI shows colored badges for all sources per concept
  - `source_uris` persisted in vocabulary.json for downstream consumers
- **Global vocabulary shipped with package** — default vocabulary bundled in `inventory_md/data/`
  - Multi-location vocabulary loading with merge precedence:
    1. Package default (lowest priority)
    2. `/etc/inventory-md/vocabulary.yaml`
    3. `~/.config/inventory-md/vocabulary.yaml`
    4. `./vocabulary.yaml` or `./local-vocabulary.yaml` (highest priority)
  - New functions: `find_vocabulary_files()`, `load_global_vocabulary()`
- **Language fallback chains** for translations
  - Scandinavian: `nb` → `no` → `da` → `nn` → `sv` → `en`
  - Germanic: `de` → `de-AT` → `de-CH` → `nl` → `en`
  - Romance: `es` → `pt` → `it` → `fr` → `en`
  - Slavic: `ru` → `uk` → `be` → `bg` → `en`
  - Configurable via `language_fallbacks` in config
  - Integrated into AGROVOC (`_get_all_labels`) and OFF (`get_labels`) lookups
  - When a translation is missing, tries related languages before English
  - New functions: `get_fallback_chain()`, `apply_language_fallbacks()`
- **Config file naming** — `config.yaml`/`config.json` now supported in project directory
  - `inventory-md.yaml`/`inventory-md.json` still supported for backward compatibility
- **DBpedia descriptions, Wikipedia URLs, and source attribution**
  - Concepts enriched with short descriptions from DBpedia/Wikipedia
  - Wikipedia article links stored on concepts for UI linking
  - Source attribution tracks which external source provided each concept
- **Local vocab enrichment via DBpedia** — even concepts not in inventory get
  DBpedia metadata (URI, description, wikipediaUrl) when they have a `broader` field
- **`category_by_source` hierarchy preservation** — original source hierarchies
  stored under `category_by_source/<source>/` (OFF, AGROVOC, DBpedia, Wikidata)
  so the raw taxonomy paths survive root mapping
- **Virtual root node** (`_root`) for explicit root control and display ordering
- **Multi-source translation with URI resolution and gap filling**
  - OFF → AGROVOC → DBpedia → Wikidata translation pipeline
  - Each phase fills gaps without overwriting earlier sources
  - Sanity checks reject mismatched labels from every source
- **Wikidata as full independent category source**
  - Concept lookup via Wikidata API
  - Hierarchy building via P31 (instance of) and P279 (subclass of) relations
  - `category_by_source/wikidata/` entries following the same pattern as DBpedia
  - Opt-in via `enabled_sources=["off", "agrovoc", "dbpedia", "wikidata"]`
- **Wikidata translation source and final language fallback pass**
  - Wikidata labels fetched via sitelinks for multilingual coverage
  - Final pass applies `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_FALLBACKS` to every concept after all
    translation phases, filling gaps like `nb` from `sv`/`da`/`nn`
- **Auto-resolve URIs for local vocab concepts** — new `_resolve_missing_uris()`
  helper batch-queries DBpedia/Wikidata by prefLabel for concepts without URIs,
  enabling translations for previously unreachable concepts

### Changed
- **SKOS lookups routed through tingbok on cache miss** — when `tingbok.url`
  is configured, `SKOSClient` calls tingbok's `/api/skos/lookup` and
  `/api/skos/labels/batch` instead of contacting upstream AGROVOC/DBpedia/Wikidata
  REST APIs directly; network errors fall back to the direct path transparently
- **Skip AGROVOC database load when tingbok is configured** —
  `build_vocabulary_with_skos_hierarchy()` now accepts `tingbok_url` and,
  when set, creates `SKOSClient(use_oxigraph=False)` so the local AGROVOC
  Oxigraph database (~30 s load) is never loaded; upstream SKOS lookups on
  cache misses fall through to the REST APIs as before
- **`Concept.altLabels` changed from `list[str]` to `dict[str, list[str]]`**
  (language → labels) — prevents cross-language false matches (e.g. Norwegian
  "barn" matching English "Barn"); new helpers `get_alt_labels(lang)` and
  `get_all_alt_labels_flat()`; backward compat: flat list wrapped as `{"en": [...]}`
- **Language alias expansion in translation fetch** — `nb↔no` and other aliases
  resolved in all four translation phases (OFF, AGROVOC, DBpedia, Wikidata) so
  OFF's `"no"` labels are fetched and normalised to `"nb"` via fallback chain
- **Distinct `source="package"` for bundled vocabulary** — concepts loaded from the
  package data directory now get `source="package"` instead of `source="local"`,
  making it possible to distinguish package-provided concepts from user-defined ones
- **Wikidata enabled by default** — `enabled_sources` now includes `"wikidata"` in
  all defaults (vocabulary.py, config.py, cli.py); no longer opt-in
- **SPARQL timeout reduced** from 300 s to 30 s
- **Cache empty label results** from succeeded SPARQL queries (to avoid redundant
  re-fetches of concepts with no labels in a given language)
- Merged 18 root categories down to 10: new `recreation` root (outdoor, sports,
  transport); `hardware` absorbs construction and consumables; `household` absorbs
  office, books, documents; `medical` renamed "Health & Safety" and absorbs
  safety-equipment; `hobby` deleted (redundant with transport)
- Renamed `toilet_consumable_paper` → `toilet_paper` in package vocabulary
- Vocabulary deduplication: flat concepts with `broader` are merged into their
  path-prefixed form (e.g., `ac-cable` → `electronics/ac-cable`), removing 138
  orphaned flat duplicates
- Vocabulary slimmed to ~258 concepts (from 596) by removing pure-redirect leaves
- `lang` field written to `inventory.json` so the search UI can auto-detect the
  inventory language; bare `no` in YAML config correctly mapped to language code
- Category label language in search UI initialised from inventory `lang` config
  (was hardcoded to `en`)

### Fixed
- **Parser dropping containers under ID-less structural sections** — sections
  without an explicit `ID:` tag are now treated as organizational wrappers; their
  subsections are still processed as containers but the wrapper itself is not added
  to the inventory; previously a section like "# Oversikt over boksene" caused a
  hard return that silently dropped all 189 containers nested beneath it; hard-coded
  Norwegian/English section name strings removed — configurable via
  `sections.intro` and `sections.numbering_scheme` config keys
- **AGROVOC cross-language mismatches** — leaf URI looked up from the full path
  key; singular/plural variants accepted; false positives from cross-language
  matches eliminated
- **AGROVOC mismatch warnings eliminated** — 14 further false-positive warnings
  during vocabulary build suppressed:
  - AGROVOC lookup skipped when local concept already has a non-AGROVOC URI (9 cases)
  - DBpedia URIs added to mushrooms, lumber, marine_propulsion, medicine (4 cases)
- **altLabel translation map** not using language fallback chain (fixed)
- **Orphan categories promoted** to tree roots for UI visibility
- **Oxigraph startup warning** silenced when `use_oxigraph=False`
- Multi-source translation URI resolution: candidate URIs collected from both
  `all_uri_maps` and `concept.uri`, filtered by source type
- Duplicate connector definitions removed from vocabulary.yaml
- Full broader chain resolution (e.g., `sandpaper-sheet` → `consumables/sandpaper/sandpaper-sheet`)
- OFF mapped roots excluded from URI map to prevent translation mismatches
