* Should be easy to install and adapt
* Currently used for "Solveig" and "Furuset".
* IDs should be better thought through
* Furuset: reintegrate the new script and ensure the existing structure does not break too much
* Solveig: take photos
* We should remove links to photos from the markdown document.  The script should auto-detect the presense of photos in the correct folders.
* We should make a demo system
* The inventory system should be published when it's more or less ready for public usage
